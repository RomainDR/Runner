# TikTok-Integrated Minecraft Game Mode

Welcome to the repository for a unique Minecraft game mode that integrates with TikTok's API to create an interactive and engaging experience for both players and viewers!

## Project Overview

This project introduces a custom game mode for Minecraft where the primary objective is to cross the finish line a set number of times. The twist? It's integrated with TikTok's API, allowing viewers to send gifts that trigger various in-game actions. These actions can include sending TNT, destroying parts of the map, or even setting the player back, making the gameplay dynamic and unpredictable.

### Key Features:
- **Interactive Gameplay:** Viewers can influence the game in real-time by sending gifts through TikTok.
- **Dynamic Challenges:** Each gift can alter the game environment, providing a fresh challenge with every playthrough.
- **Engagement:** Enhances viewer interaction by allowing them to directly impact the game's outcome.
